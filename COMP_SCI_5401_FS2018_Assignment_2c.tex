\section{Methodology}
Describe the custom parts of your EA design, such as your function and terminal sets,
in sufficient detail to allow someone else to implement a functionally equivalent EA, and explain
your EA design decisions.

\section{Experimental Setup}
Provide your experimental setup in sufficient detail to allow exact duplication
of your experiments (i.e., producing the exact same results within statistical margins) and justify
your choice of EA strategy parameters.

\section{Results}
List your experimental results in both tabular and graphical formats (box plots preferred)
along with your statistical results, corresponding to the three configuration and log files, and six
solution files, referenced above (so youâ€™ll have three plots and a table containing your statistical
comparison of the three combinations).

\section{Discussion}
Discuss your experimental and statistical results, providing valuable insights such as conjectures
you induce from your results. Your choice of what to report on and how you go about
rationalizing it is your subjective interpretation.

\section{Conclusion}
Conclude your report by stating your most important findings and insights in the conclusion
section.

\section{Bibliography}
This is where you provide your citation details, if you cited anything. Only list references
here that you actually cite in your report.

\section{Appendices}
If you have more data you want to show than what you could reasonably fit in the body
of your report, this is the place to put it along with a short description.
